## Python Application GitHub Workflow Documentation

This documentation provides an explanation of the GitHub Actions workflow file for a Python application. The workflow file is responsible for installing Python dependencies, running tests, and performing linting using a single version of Python.

The workflow file, typically named `.github/workflows/main.yml`, is triggered when there is a push or pull request event on the `main` branch.

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow starts with the workflow configuration section, defined using the `name` and `on` keywords. It also includes a `permissions` section to specify the read permissions for contents.

```yaml
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read
```

- `name`: Specifies the name of the workflow, which is "Python application" in this case.
- `on`: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, the workflow is triggered on push events and pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
- `permissions`: Specifies the read permissions for the contents, allowing the workflow to access the repository code.

### Job Steps

The job contains several steps, each performing a specific task. The steps are executed in the order they are defined. Here are the steps in the workflow:

1. **Checkout**: The `actions/checkout` action is used to check out the repository code. It ensures that the workflow has access to the latest code changes.

```yaml
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

2. **Set up Python**: The `actions/setup-python` action is used to set up the Python environment for the job. It installs the specified version of Python, which is Python 3.8 in this case because it is the minimal requirement specified in the base code.

```yaml
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.8"
```

3. **Install dependencies**: This step installs the necessary Python dependencies for the project. It installs `pipenv`, `flake8`, and `pytest`. If there is a `requirements.txt` file in the project, it installs the dependencies listed in that file.

```yaml
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install pipenv
        pip install flake8 
      working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}
```

4. **Lint with flake8**: This step performs linting on the code using `flake8`. It checks for Python syntax errors, undefined names, and enforces code complexity and line length limits.

```yaml
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```

1. **Run tests**: This step runs the tests for the Python application using `pipenv`. It executes the tests and reports the results.

```yaml
    - name: Run tests
      run: pipenv run test
      working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}
```

- `working-directory`: Specifies the working directory for the step, which is set to the GitHub workspace. It ensures that the commands are executed in the correct directory.

### Conclusion

This GitHub Actions workflow file automates the process of installing Python dependencies, running tests, and performing linting for a Python application. By leveraging this workflow, you can ensure code quality and maintain consistency in your Python projects. It is important to note that the scripts for the pipenv commands are set up in the pipfile.
